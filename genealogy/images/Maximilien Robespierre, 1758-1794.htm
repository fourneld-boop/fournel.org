      width=140 align=left>Maximilien Marie Isidore de Robespierre was born, of 
      Irish origin, at Arras, May 6, 1758. He was admitted <EM>avocat</EM> in 
      1781, and was elected to the Estates General in 1789 by Artois. He 
      attached himself to the extreme left wing, and soon commanded attention. 
      His influence grew daily, and the mob frantically admired his earnest cant 
      and his boasted incorruptibility.</P>
      <P align=left>In 1791 he carried the motion that no member of the present 
      Assembly should be eligible for the next, and was appointed public 
      accuser. Next followed the flight to Varennes (June 21), Lafayette's last 
      effort to control the right of insurrection on the Champ-de-Mars (July 
      17), the abject terror of Robespierre, his hysterical appeal to the Club, 
      the theatrical oath taken by every member to defend his life, and his 
      conduct home in triumph by the mob at the close of the Constituent 
      Assembly (September 30). The Girondist leaders in the new Legislative 
      Assembly were eager for war. Robespierre offered a strenuous opposition in 
      the Jacobin Club.</P>
      <P align=left>In April 1792 he resigned his post of public accuser. In 
      August he presented to the Legislative Assembly a petition for a 
      Revolutionary Tribunal and a new Convention. It does not appear that he 
      was in any way responsible for the September massacres. He was elected 
      first deputy for Paris to the national Convention, where the bitter 
      attacks upon him by the Girondists threw him into closer union with 
      Danton.</P>
      <P align=left>Robespierre vigorously opposed the Girondist idea of a 
      special appeal to the people on the king's death, and Louis's execution on 
      January 21, 1793, opened up the final stages of the struggle, which ended 
      in a complete triumph of the Jacobins on June 2.</P>
      <P align=left>The first Committee of Public Safety was decreed in April 
      1793, and Robespierre, elected in July, was now one of the actual rulers 
      of France (along with the rest of the Twelve). Next came the dark 
      intrigues and desperate struggles that sent Hébert and his friends to the 
      guillotine in March 1794, and Danton and Camille Desmoulins in April. The 
      next three months Robespierre reigned supreme. he nominated all the 
      members of the Government Committees, placed his men in all places of 
      influence in the commune of Paris, and assumed complete control of the 
      Revolutionary Tribunal.</P>
      <P align=left>However, as his power increased, his popularity waned. On 
      May 7 Robespierre, who had previously condemned the Cult of Reason, 
      advocated a new state religion and recommended the Convention to 
      acknowledge the existence of God; on June 8 the inaugural Festival of the 
      Supreme being took place. Meanwhile, the pace of the guillotine grew 
      faster; public finance and government generally drifted to ruin, and 
      Saint-Just demanded the creation of a dictatorship in the person of 
      Robespierre. On July 26, the dictator delivered a long harangue 
      complaining that he was being accused of crimes unjustly. The Convention, 
      after at first obediently passing his decrees, next rescinded them and 
      referred his proposals to the committees. That night at the Jacobin Club 
      his party again triumphed. At the Convention the following day, Saint-Just 
      could not obtain a hearing, and Robespierre was vehemently attacked (the 
      9th of Thermidor). A deputy proposed his arrest; at the fatal word 
      Robespierre's power came to an end.</P>
      <P align=left>He fled to the Common Hall, whereupon the Convention 
      declared him an outlaw. The National Guard under Barras turned out to 
      protect the Convention, and Robespierre had his lower jaw broken by a shot 
      fired by a gendarme. The next day (July 28, the 10th of Thermidor), he was 
      sent to the guillotine along with Saint-Just, Couthon, and nineteen 
      others.</P>
