  <p><span class="style4">7419: The "Spirit Cave man" lived around this time in Nevada, United
  States. Using new dating techniques, researchers discovered that the mummy known as the
  "Spirit Cave man" was buried 9,417 years ago (as of 1998), about 6,500 years
  earlier than previously estimated. The mummy was found in 1940 by S.M. and Georgia
  Wheeler, married archaeologists hired by the state to excavate what they labelled
  the
  "Spirit Cave," about 60 miles east of Carson City. Woven bags and other everyday
  artefacts were found nearby. Two bags contained ashes and bone fragments of two other
  people who had been cremated. The man had features similar to other earlier skeletons
  found in North America: a long, relatively small face and a long cranium --
  characteristics different than those of modern American Indians.</span></p>

  <p>6500-5650: Catal Hulyuk is settled (village in Turkey)</p>
  <p>6000-5300: Halaf Culture inhabited the Kurdish mountains. Named for the ancient
  mound of Tel Halaf in what is now Syrian Kurdistan (west of the town of Qamishli), this
  culture is best known for its easily recognizable style of pottery which, fortunately, was
  produced in abundance. Exquisitely painted, delicately designed Halaf pottery is easily
  distinguishable from earlier and later productions</p>

  Egypt</a></p>
  <p>5300-4300: The Halaf cultural period ends with the arrival of a new culture,
  and quite likely a new people: the Ubaidians. 'Ubaid Culture' expanded from the plains of
  Mesopotamia into the mountains. The Ubaidians, or protoEuphratians, as they are sometimes
  called, caused a hybrid culture to emerge in the mountains, comprised of their own
  cultural heritage and that of the earlier Halaf. It predominated in most of Kurdistan and
  Mesopotamia for the ensuing 1000 years. </p>
  <p>Of the language or ethnic affliation of the Ubaidians we know nothing beyond
  conjecture. However, it is they who gave the names Tigris and Euphrates to the rivers of
  Kurdistan and Mesopotamia, as well as the names of almost all of the cities we now
  recognize as Sumerian. The cultural impact of the Ubaidians on the mountain communities
  could have been vast, though apparently it was not particularly deep. </p>
  <p>5000: Maize &amp; bean cultivation in Mexico </p>

  <p align="center">Indus Valley Civilization</p>
  <p>4300-2000: A new culture, and possibly a new people, came to dominate the
  Kurdistan mountains: the Hurrians. Of the Hurrians we know much more, and the volume of
  our knowledge becomes greater with time. We know, for example, that the Hurrians spread
  far and wide into the Zagros-Taurus mountain systems and intruded for a time on the
  neighbouring plains of Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau. However, they never expanded
  far from the mountains. Their economy was surprisingly integrated and focused,
  along with their political bonds, which ran generally parallel to the Zagros-Taurus mountains rather
  than radiating out to the lowlands, as was the case during the preceding Ubaid cultural
  period. Mountain plain economic exchanges remained of secondary importance, judging by the
  archaeological remains of goods and their origins. </p>
  <p>The Hurrians spoke a language or languages of the north-eastern group of the
  Caucasian family of languages, distantly related to modern Lezgian and, by extension, to
  Georgian and Laz. The direction of their expansion is not yet understood and by no means
  should be taken as having been north-south, in other words, as an expansion out of the
  Caucuses. (It may well be that it was the Hurrians who introduced Caucasian languages into
  the Caucasus.)</p>
  <p>For a long time the states founded by the Hurrians remained small, until around
  2500 BC when larger political-military entities evolved out of the older city-states. Four
  polities are of special note: Urartu, Mushku, Subaru and Guti/Qutil. The kingdom of Mushku
  is now believed to have brought about the final downfall of the Hittites in Anatolia.
  Their name survives in the city of Mush/Mus in north central Kurdistan of Turkey. The
  Subaru, who operated from the areas north of modern Arbil in central Kurdistan, have left
  their name in the populous and historic Kurdish tribal confederacy of Zubari, who still
  inhabit the areas north of Arbil. The name of Mount Ararat is a legacy of the Urartu. The
  Qutils of central and southern Kurdistan, after gradually unifying the smaller mountain
  principalities, became strong enough in 2250 BC to actually annex Sumeria and the rest of
  lowland Mesopotamia. A Qutil dynasty ruled Sumeria for 130 years until 2120 BC. </p>
  <p>Two legendary empires, Melidi and Aratta, served the Hurrians in their
  inter-regional trade with the economies outside the mountains. With much certainty, Melidi
  is to be identified with modern Malatya, while Aratta is probably to be identified with
  the rich Qutil archaeological site of Godin Teppa near Kangawar in southern Kurdistan. By
  the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the culture and people of Kurdistan appear to have
  been unified under a Hurrian identity. The fundamental legacy of the Hurrians to the
  present culture of the Kurds is manifest in the realm of religion, mythology, martial
  arts, and even genetics. Nearly two-thirds of Kurdish tribal, topological and urban names
  are also likely of Hurrian origin: Buhtan, Talaban, Jelali, Barzan; Mardin, Ziwiya and
  Dinawar, to name a few. Mythological and religious symbols present in the art of the later
  Hurrian dynastics such as the Mannaeans of eastern Kurdistan, and the Lullus of the south,
  present in part what can still be observed in the Kurdish ancient religion of Yazdanism,
  better known today by its various denominations, such as Alevism, Yezidism, and Yar-
  sanism (Ahl-i Haqq). </p>
  <p>It is fascinating to recognize the origin of many tattooing motifs still used
  by traditional Kurds to decorate their bodies as replicas of those which appear on Hurrian
  figurines. One such is the combination that incorporates serpent, sun disc, dog and comb
  motifs. In fact some of these Hurrian tattoo motifs are also present in the religious
  decorative arts of the Yezidi Kurds. </p>
  <p>By the end of the Hurrian period, Kurdistan seems to have been culturally and
  ethnically homogenized to form a single civilization which was identified as such by
  neighboring cultures and peoples.</p>

  <p align="center">Shang Dynasty of China</p>
  <p>The Shang dynasty (also called the Yin dynasty in its later stages) is believed
  to have been founded by a rebel leader who overthrew the last Xia ruler. Its civilization
  was based on agriculture, augmented by hunting and animal husbandry. Two important events
  of the period were the development of a writing system, as revealed in archaic Chinese
  inscriptions found on tortoise shells and flat cattle bones (commonly called oracle bones
  or, and the use of bronze metallurgy. A number of ceremonial bronze vessels with
  inscriptions date from the Shang period; the workmanship on the bronzes attests to a high
  level of civilization. </p>
  <p>A line of hereditary Shang kings ruled over much of northern China, and Shang
  troops fought frequent wars with neighboring settlements and nomadic herdsmen from the
  inner Asian steppes. The capitals, one of which was at the site of the modern city of
  Anyang, were centers of glittering court life. Court rituals to propitiate spirits and to
  honor sacred ancestors were highly developed. In addition to his secular position, the
  king was the head of the ancestor- and spirit-worship cult. Evidence from the royal tombs
  indicates that royal personages were buried with articles of value, presumably for use in
  the afterlife. Perhaps for the same reason, hundreds of commoners, who may have been
  slaves, were buried alive with the royal corpse. </p>
  <p>1749-1712: Samsuiluna: Babylonian King, battled with Kassites, Sealand</p>
  <p>1720: The ancient (Canaanite and Israelite) city of Hebron was founded at Tel
  Rumeida. The city's history has been inseparably linked with the Cave of Machpelah, which
  the Patriarch Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite for 400 silver shekels (Genesis
  23), as a family tomb. As recorded in Genesis, the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
  and the Matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca and Leah, are buried there, and -- according to a Jewish
  tradition -- Adam and Eve are also buried there.</p>

  <p>Sheep bones carved with Chinese characters are created. Characters found on the
  bones include an upside-down "V" that experts deciphered as the Chinese word for
  "six" and a symbol that means "divination,". Six other characters
  carved roughly but deeply onto the two fragments of shoulder blade have not been
  deciphered as of 1998. The bones were unearthed from a pit at an ancient sacrificial site
  in east China's Shandong province but Xinhua did not report when they were discovered. </p>
  <p>In ancient China, bones were used by soothsayers who attempted to divine the
  future. These fortunetellers heated bones or turtle shells until they cracked and then
  "read" the fissures in the bone or shell to predict the likelihood of such
  things as rainfall. In China's Shang Dynasty, more than 3,000 years ago, divining was
  often used by kings who wanted to know their future or have problems answered. Sometimes
  the forecast and eventual outcome were carved onto bones, a procedure that has provided
  some of the earliest known examples of Chinese writing. </p>
  <p>Bones with inscriptions written by oracles were first found in central China's
  Henan province in ruins dating back to the late Shang Dynasty, around 1200 B.C. Xinhua
  said. So far, only about 1,000 of the more than 10,000 characters found in Henan have been
  deciphered, it added. Inscriptions on the Shandong sheep blades, meanwhile, are believed
  to be nearly 300 years older than those found in Henan, offering even earlier clues about
  the development of Chinese language, Xinhua said. </p>
  <p>The bones, which had been burnt, were stored at the bottom of a pit
  crisscrossed with beams. Pottery and stoneware found with the bones were typical of
  China's ancient Yueshi culture that existed from 1500 B.C. to 2000 B.C., Xinhua said. It
  quoted unnamed experts as saying that the inscriptions on the sheep bones "are the
  oldest written language ever found." </p>
  <p>But there are even earlier examples of Chinese writing, with the earliest being
  symbols on neolithic pottery found near Xi'an, home of China's famed terra cotta warriors,
  that dates back as far as 8,000 to 5,000 B.C, according to the Cambridge Encyclopedia of
  China. </p>

  <p>1200-900/750: 1st Dark Age: Many city-states and kingdoms in the Near East and
  Greece were weakened or obliterated in the disruptions of the period 1200-1000 B.C., and
  these misfortunes brought grinding poverty to many of the people who did survive the
  troubles of this age. Enormous difficulties impede our understanding of the history of
  this troubled period and of the period of recovery that followed because few literary or
  documentary sources exist to supplement the incomplete information provided by
  archaeology. Both because conditions were so gloomy for so many people and because we have
  only a dim view of what happened in these years, it is customary to refer to the era
  beginning in the twelfth/eleventh centuries as a Dark Age: the fortunes of the people of
  the time seem generally dark, as does our understanding of the period. The Near East
  recovered its strength much sooner than did Greece, ending its Dark Age by around 900 B.C.
  The Greeks did not fully recover until perhaps a hundred and fifty years after that.</p>

  <p>1111-771: Western Zhou (Chou) dynasty of China: western at Hao, eastern at Luoyi,
  Beijing founded, script fully developed (Chou wen), brush &amp; ink painting.</p>
  <p>The last Shang ruler, a despot according to standard Chinese accounts, was
  overthrown by a chieftain of a frontier tribe called Zhou, which had settled in the Wei
  Valley in modern Shaanxi Province. The Zhou dynasty had its capital at Hao, near the city
  of Xi'an , or Chang'an, as it was known in its heyday in the imperial period. Sharing the
  language and culture of the Shang, the early Zhou rulers, through conquest and
  colonization, gradually sinicized, that is, extended Shang culture through much of China
  Proper north of the Chang Jiang (Yangtze River). The Zhou dynasty lasted longer than any
  other, from 1111 to 221 B.C. It was philosophers of this period who first enunciated the
  doctrine of the "mandate of heaven" (tianming), the notion that the ruler (the
  "son of heaven" or governed by divine right but that his dethronement would
  prove that he had lost the mandate. The doctrine explained and justified the demise of the
  two earlier dynasties and at the same time supported the legitimacy of present and future
  rulers. </p>
  <p>The term feudal has often been applied to the Zhou period because the Zhou's
  early decentralized rule invites comparison with medieval rule in Europe. At most,
  however, the early Zhou system was proto-feudal, being a more sophisticated version of
  earlier tribal organization, in which effective control depended more on familial ties
  than on feudal legal bonds. Whatever feudal elements there may have been decreased as time
  went on. The Zhou amalgam of city-states became progressively centralized and established
  increasingly impersonal political and economic institutions. These developments, which
  probably occurred in the latter Zhou period, were manifested in greater central control
  over local governments and a more routinized agricultural taxation. </p>
  <p>In 771 B.C. the Zhou court was sacked, and its king was killed by invading
  barbarians who were allied with rebel lords. The capital was moved eastward to Luoyang in
  present-day Henan Province. Because of this shift, historians divide the Zhou era into
  Western Zhou (1111-771 B.C.) and Eastern Zhou (770-221 B.C.). With the royal line broken,
  the power of the Zhou court gradually diminished; the fragmentation of the kingdom
  accelerated. Eastern Zhou divides into two subperiods. The first, from 770 to 476 B.C., is
  called the Spring and Autumn Period, after a famous historical chronicle of the time; the
  second is known as the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.).</p>

  part of various rituals in many cultures, including Egyptian, Greek and Roman. In the 11th
  century BC, land routes through Arabia were greatly improved by using the camel as a beast
  of burden, and frankincense was carried from its production centre at Qana (now known as
  Bir 'Ali) to Gaza in Egypt. The camel caravans also carried gold and other precious goods
  which arrived in Qana by sea from India. The Minaeans established their capital at Karna

  <p align="center">Israel under King Solomon</p>
  <p>950-115: The Minaeans of southern Arabia are superseded by the Sabaeans. The Sabaean
  capital was Ma'rib, where a large temple was built - Sabaean civilization
  reached its peak with the transfer of power from the mukarribs (priest-kings) to
  autocratic monarchs (7th century BC). The ancient city, in a fertile oasis irrigated by
  the impounded waters of the Ma'rib Dam, has been called "the Paris of the ancient
  world." It was on one of the principal caravan routes that linked the Mediterranean
  world and the Arabian Peninsula, and it prospered especially because of its trading
  monopoly of frankincense and myrrh from Yemen and the southern coastal region of
  Hadhramaut.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Sabaean civilization was based not only on the spice trade, but also on
  agriculture. The impressive dam, built at Ma'rib in the 8th century BC, provided
  irrigation for farmland and stood for over a millennium. Some Sabaean carved inscriptions
  from this period are still extant. The Himyarites established their capital at Dhafar (now
  just a small village in the Ibb region) and gradually absorbed the Sabaean kingdom. They
  were culturally inferior to the Sabaeans and traded from the port of al-Muza on the Red
  Sea. By the first century BC, the area had been conquered by the Romans. </p>

  <p>677/676: The Abomination of Desolation prophecy referred to in Leviticus 26:14-33
  commences during the reign of the evil Hebrew king Manasseh. King Manasseh was the first
  of many of the Hebrew kings who had attempted to lead the Jewish people away from the
  religion of Moses and, in it's place, replace it with local pagan cults. Manasseh allowed
  these pagan cults to erect altars inside the Temple of Solomon where idols were worshipped
  and sacrifices were offered to pagan gods. Among other abominations, Manasseh was also
  said to have allowed ritual prostitution to be practiced inside the Holy Temple. &nbsp;
  Moses' prophecy quickly took effect when the Assyrians swept down from the north,
  conquered Jerusalem and King Manasseh himself was carried off in chains to Babylon. This
  was the beginning of the seven times era of subjugation foretold by Moses.&nbsp; Referring
  back to the Leviticus 26 prophecy again we see that Moses said that this 'Abomination' and
  'scattering among the Gentiles' time period would last for seven times. Seven times or
  seven years of 360 days in a year equals 2,520 'days' [means 2,520 years]</p>

  <p>602: Daniel prophesied a "seven-times" (Daniel 4:23) span from the year
  602 BC. "Seven-times" is repeated three times in Daniel 4 which indicates that a
  hidden prophecy is contained here. Daniel 4:29 mentions "after twelve months"
  which calls our attention to the word 'month' or 'moonth' - and hints that the lunar
  (moon) calendar is in use for unsealing this prophecy. It states that "after twelve
  months" Nebuchadnezzar goes insane and "seven-times" are to pass over him. </p>
  <p>A time is 360 years, a year of years. Seven times 360 is 2520 'lunar' years ...
  which is 2445 solar years from 602 BC (1 solar year = 1.03069 lunar years). The date for
  the fulfillment of the "seven-times" becomes 2445 - 602 +1 (year 0 of Christian
  Calendar) = 1844 AD. </p>
  <p>To confirm 602 BC as the starting point of this prophecy, we start with 604 BC - the
  year that Nebuchadnezzar became king. Daniel 2:1 says that in the second year of his reign
  (603 BC), Nebuchadnezzar began to have dreams. No further dates are given until Daniel
  4:29 already sited, where it reads "after twelve months" when Nebuchadnezzar
  goes insane and the "seven-times" are to pass over him. Thus the "twelve
  months" are from 603 BC to 602 BC.</p>

  of Jesus; though they are authoritative for him, he does not appear to enquire how their
  authenticity is ensured. In two of the three instances that he speaks of remembering 'the
  words' of Christ or of the Lord Jesus, it seems that he has a written record in mind, but
  he does not call it a 'gospel'. He knows several of Paul's epistles, and values them
  highly for their content; the same can be said of the Epistle to the Hebrews, with which
  he is well acquainted. Although these writings obviously possess for Clement considerable
  significance, he never refers to them as authoritative 'Scripture'.} [Canon

  teaching as necessity demanded but not making, as it were, an arrangement of the Lord's
  oracles, so that Mark did nothing wrong in thus writing down single points as he
  remembered them. For to 1 thing he gave attention, to leave out nothing of what he had
  heard &amp; to make no false statements in them.'" This is related by Papias about

  of April 25th 1792, Rouget de Lisle penned the 'Chant de guerre pour l'armée du Rhine'
  - War song for the Rhine Army, named in honour of the garrison to which he belonged.
  The song was published under the name of 'Chant de guerre aux armées des frontières'
  - Border armies' war song by an Egyptian Army general, François Mireur, who was in
  Marseille to organise a march of revolutionary volunteers on King Louis XVI's Tuileries
  palace. Ironically, since Rouget de Lisle supported the monarchy, the revolutionaries
  adopted the song and sang it with such fervour as they entered the capital, on July 30th
  1792, that the Parisians named it 'La Marseillaise'.</p>

  Hegel (1770-1831), German philosopher, writes "Phenomenology of
  Mind". His writings include theories of ethics, aesthetics, history, politics, and
  religion. At the center of the universe Hegel posited an enveloping absolute spirit that
  guides all reality, including human reason. His absolute idealism envisages a world-soul,
  evident throughout history, that develops from, and is known through, a process of change
  and progress now known universally as the Hegelian dialectic. According to its laws, one
  concept (thesis) inevitably generates its opposite (antithesis); their interaction leads
  to a new concept (synthesis), which in turn becomes the thesis of a new triad. Thus
  philosophy enables human beings to comprehend the historical unfolding of the absolute.
  Hegel's application of the dialectic to the concept of conflict of cultures stimulated
  historical analysis and, in the political arena, made him a hero to those working for a
  unified Germany. He was a major influence on subsequent idealist thinkers and on such
  philosophers as Kierkegaard and Sartre; perhaps his most far-reaching effect was his
  influence on Karl Marx, who substituted materialism for idealism in his formulation of
  dialectical materialism. </p>
