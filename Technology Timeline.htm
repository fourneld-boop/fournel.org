		<h2>Technology Timeline</h2>
		<p>What follows is a loose system of classification used to determine the
  approximate level of technological and socio-political advancement for sentient life on Earth
  and eventually elsewhere in the Universe. The time span from 7 million B.C. up to the
  present is based on legitimate archaeological discoveries and historical records. Everything
  after that is based partly on current scientific theories and partly on my own
  speculations.</p>

			Saints). The Bahá'í Faith emerges out of 19th century Shi'ah Persia. 
			Newspapers are common. Radio and Television is invented. World War I

			developed in 1945 thereby beginning the Cold War between the East 
			(Soviet Union and allies) and West (United States and allies). In

			complete recording and summation of daily financial dealings began 
			to be realized. In 1995 the World Trade Organization is founded.<br>&nbsp;<br>2009<br>A $1,000 personal computer can perform about a trillion calculations 
			per second. Personal computers with high-resolution visual displays 
			come in a range of sizes, from those small enough to be embedded in 
			clothing and jewellery up to the size of a thin book.<br>&nbsp; Cables are disappearing. Communication between components uses 
			short-distance wireless technology. High-speed wireless 
			communication provides access to the Web.<br>&nbsp; The majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition. Also 
			ubiquitous are language user interfaces (LUIs).<br>&nbsp; Most routine business transactions (purchases, travel, reservations) take 
			place between a human and a virtual personality. Often, the virtual 
			personality includes an animated visual presence that looks like a 
			human face.<br>&nbsp; Although traditional classroom organization is still common, intelligent 
			courseware has emerged as a common means of learning.<br>&nbsp; Pocket-sized reading machines for the blind and visually impaired, 
			"listening machines" (speech-to-text conversion) for the deaf, and 
			computer- controlled orthotic devices for paraplegic individuals 
			result in a growing perception that primary disabilities do not 
			necessarily impart handicaps.<br>&nbsp; Translating telephones (speech-to-speech language translation) are 
			commonly used for many language pairs.<br>&nbsp; Accelerating returns from the advance of computer technology have 
			resulted in continued economic expansion. Price deflation, which had 
			been a reality in the computer field during the twentieth century, 
			is now occurring outside the computer field. The reason for this is 
			that virtually all economic sectors are deeply affected by the 
			accelerating improvement in the price performance of computing.<br>&nbsp; Human musicians routinely jam with cybernetic musicians.<br>&nbsp; Bioengineered treatments for cancer and heart disease have greatly 
			reduced the mortality from these diseases.<br>&nbsp; The neo-Luddite movement is growing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<br>2019<br>A $1,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is now approximately 
			equal to the computational ability of the human brain. Computers are 
			now largely invisible and are embedded everywhere-in walls, tables, 
			chairs, desks, clothing, jewelry, and bodies.<br>&nbsp; Three-dimensional virtual reality displays, embedded in glasses and 
			contact lenses, as well as auditory "lenses," are used routinely as 
			primary interfaces for communication with other persons, computers, 
			the Web, and virtual reality.<br>&nbsp; Most interaction with computing is through gestures and two-way 
			natural-language spoken communication.<br>&nbsp; Nanoengineered machines are beginning to be applied to manufacturing and 
			process-control applications.<br>&nbsp; High-resolution, three-dimensional visual and auditory virtual reality 
			and realistic all-encompassing tactile environments enable people to 
			do virtually anything with anybody, regardless of physical 
			proximity.<br>&nbsp; Paper books or documents are rarely used and most learning is conducted 
			through intelligent, simulated software-based teachers.<br>&nbsp; Blind persons routinely use eyeglass-mounted reading-navigation systems. 
			Deaf persons read what other people are saying through their lens 
			displays. Paraplegic and some quadriplegic persons routinely walk 
			and climb stairs through a combination of computer-controlled nerve 
			stimulation and exoskeletal robotic devices.<br>&nbsp; The vast majority of transactions include a simulated person.<br>&nbsp; Automated driving systems are now installed in most roads.<br>&nbsp; People are beginning to have relationships with automated personalities 
			and use them as companions, teachers, caretakers, and lovers.<br>&nbsp; Virtual artists, with their own reputations, are emerging in all of the 
			arts.<br>&nbsp; There are widespread reports of computers passing the Turing Test, 
			although these tests do not meet the criteria established by 
			knowledgeable observers.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>2029<br>A $1,000 (in 1999 dollars) unit of computation has the computing 
			capacity of approximately 1,000 human brains. Permanent or removable 
			implants (similar to contact lenses) for the eyes as well as 
			cochlear implants are now used to provide input and output between 
			the human user and the worldwide computing network.<br>&nbsp; Direct neural pathways have been perfected for high-bandwidth connection 
			to the human brain. A range of neural implants is becoming available 
			to enhance visual and auditory perception and interpretation, 
			memory, and reasoning.<br>&nbsp; Automated agents are now learning on their own, and significant knowledge 
			is being created by machines with little or no human intervention. 
			Computers have read all available human- and machine-generated 
			literature and multimedia material.<br>&nbsp; There is widespread use of all-encompassing visual, auditory, and tactile 
			communication using direct neural connections, allowing virtual 
			reality to take place without having to be in a "total touch 
			enclosure."<br>&nbsp; The majority of communication does not involve a human. The majority of 
			communication involving <br>&nbsp; There is almost no human employment in production, agriculture, or

			of the human race. <br>&nbsp; There is a growing discussion about the legal rights of computers and 
			what constitutes being "human."<br>&nbsp; Although computers routinely pass apparently valid forms of the Turing 
			Test, controversy persists about whether or not machine intelligence 
			equals human intelligence in all of its diversity.<br>&nbsp; Machines claim to be conscious.&nbsp; See Artificial Intelligence. These 
			claims are largely accepted.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>2049<br>The common use of nanoproduced food, which has the correct 
			nutritional composition and the same taste and texture of 
			organically produced food, means that the availability of food is no

			A type I civilization is able to utilize the power output of an

			galaxy. One estimate is that humanity itself may reach Type III 
			status around one million AD (if it doesn't destroy itself in the 
			meantime). As of 2000 AD humanity was estimated to rate 0.7 on the
