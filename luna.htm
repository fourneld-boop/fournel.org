      <p class="hero-lede">
        By 3000 AD, Earth’s Moon is both an archive and an engine: ancient regolith,
        glittering industrial arcs, and city belts in eternal sunlight all knit
        together into a high-traffic logistics hub.

    <h2>Architecture &amp; Habitat</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Luna’s built environment is dense, layered, and relentlessly optimised to interface
      with Earth and space simultaneously.

  <section id="transport">
    <h2>Transportation &amp; Environment</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Luna is the hinge between deep gravity well and open space, with transport
      systems designed for absurdly high throughput.
    </p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Earth–Luna corridor</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple space elevator systems from Earth’s surface to high orbit, feeding a constant stream to Luna.</li>
          <li>Lunar cyclers and rapid transit shuttles operate on predictable schedules measured in days.</li>
          <li>Automated cargo pipelines move refined materials and finished goods between orbits and the surface.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Lunar surface transport</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Maglev lines and sealed rover-tubes connect poles, near-side, and far-side facilities.</li>
          <li>Personal transit pods operate in vacuum tunnels, offering shirt-sleeve commutes between hubs.</li>
          <li>Far-side observatory complexes are strictly low-traffic to preserve radio quiet.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Environment &amp; climate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No atmosphere, but highly engineered micro-environments within domes and tunnels.</li>
          <li>Thermal management is key: radiators and heat sinks dominate industrial skylines.</li>
          <li>Dust control is a major engineering and regulatory focus even in 3000 AD.</li>

  <section id="politics">
    <h2>Politics, Technology &amp; Economics</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Whoever controls Luna’s infrastructure has leverage – so Luna’s politics are
      carefully balanced inside and beyond formal treaties.
    </p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Political structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Luna is governed as a neutralised logistics and research zone under a multi-decade charter.</li>
          <li>Local councils manage city-level affairs; the Lunar Assembly coordinates with Earth and the wider federation.</li>
          <li>Strong conflict-of-interest rules limit direct control by any single planetary bloc.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Technology &amp; industry</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Heavy focus on in-situ resource utilisation and high-precision manufacturing.</li>
          <li>Lunar shipyards assemble deep-space vessels and megastructural components.</li>
          <li>Data centres and observatories cluster on the far side, shielded from Earth’s radio noise.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Economics &amp; flows</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Value flows through Luna more than it originates there – it is a hub rather than a origin point.</li>
          <li>Residents enjoy high baseline prosperity but live under tight safety and environmental rules.</li>
          <li>Tourism remains strong: people still want to stand in one-sixth gravity and watch Earthrise.</li>
